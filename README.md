# Polynomial_Interpolation

Interpolation involves fitting a curve through a set of points. It is a mathematical technique used to estimate values between known data points. This method entails constructing a function or curve that passes through an existing set of points.
Polynomial interpolation, in particular, is a technique that expresses the resulting function in the form of a polynomial. There are various applications of polynomial interpolation, such as:
Estimating a missing value: When dealing with incomplete or missing data points, polynomial interpolation can be employed to estimate the missing values based on the known points.
Creating continuous functions: This involves constructing a continuous function that precisely passes through a set of discrete points.
Curve approximation: Polynomial interpolation can be used to approximate complex curves with simpler polynomials, facilitating the mathematical or numerical analysis of these curves.

There are two different methods for performing this interpolation:
  Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation
  Newtonian Polynomial Interpolation
These two methods represent distinct approaches to achieving the same result and thus the same polynomial.
